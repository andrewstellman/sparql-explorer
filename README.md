# SPARQL Explorer - A tool for exploring RDF APIs

SPARQL Explorer is a tool for exploring REST APIs that return RDF data. You can retrieve data from the API, query it with SPARQL (using convenient SPARQL query templates), and view and save the results and the whole graph.

_Note: x.509 certificates and keys must be in RSA format. They can be converted using openssl:_ 
`openssl rsa -in x509.key -out x509.rsa.key`
